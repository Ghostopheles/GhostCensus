# GhostCensus
An addon built for collecting population data in World of Warcraft. Not for use with AI.

This addon listens to a bunch of different events in the game and uses them to grab information from every character it sees.
Here's what it collects:
- Class
- Race
- Gender
- Realm

On top of the things listed above, when used alongside TotalRP3, it also collects some usage data on the custom profile fields:
- Usage of the custom voice reference field
- Usage of the custom guild field
- Usage of the custom pronouns field
- Profile icon name

**NOTE**: I will not be providing support for this addon, it's up to you to figure out how to use it and alter it for your own use case.
