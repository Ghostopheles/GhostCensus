# GhostCensus
An addon built for collecting population data in World of Warcraft.

This addon listens to a bunch of different events in the game and uses them to grab information from every character it sees.
Here's what it collects:
- Class
- Race
- Gender
- Name
- Realm
- GUID

On top of the things listed above, when used alongside TotalRP3, it also collects some data about the player's RP profile:
- ProfileID (Used for looking up profiles in the directory)
- CharacterID (CharacterName-RealmName)
- Roleplay Status
- Formatted Name (Full RP name with color codes)
- First Name
- Last Name
- Short Title
- Full Title
- Roleplay Experience Level
- Custom Pronouns
- Profile Icon
- Custom Guild
- Voice Reference
- Trial Account Status (Paid sub vs trial character)

This addon was used to collect population data at Tournament of Ages 2023 on MoonGuard.

**NOTE**: I will not be providing support for this addon, it's up to you to figure out how to use it and alter it for your own use case. (Though I might make some exceptions)
